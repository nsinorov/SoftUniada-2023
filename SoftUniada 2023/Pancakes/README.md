We are given a string of integers - N, which represents the pancake. Each number in the series represents how much we like the filling used in that part of the pancake, with a higher number meaning we like the filling more. Write the program that finds the consecutive part of the pancake that will be most disliked (has the largest sum). As:

     If there are 2 parts with the largest amount, we choose the longer one.
     If there are 2 parts with the largest sum and the same length, we choose the one that occurs earlier in the row.
     The part of the pancake that we choose must contain at least 1 element.
